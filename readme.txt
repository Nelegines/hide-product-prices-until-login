Hide WooCommerce product prices and Add to Cart buttons unless customers are logged in or from allowed countries or roles. Ideal for wholesale stores and private shops.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Hide Prices Until Login or Region** helps store owners control who can see prices and add products to their cart. Useful for wholesale stores, restricted content, or region-specific pricing policies.

== Developer Features ==

This plugin supports integrations with premium extensions via a global override flag and centralized architecture:

- Set `$GLOBALS['hpulr_force_hide'] = true` before calling `HPULR_Price_Handler::filter_price()` to trigger the free plugin’s hidden price message
- Inject premium settings using `hpulr_additional_settings` filter
- Automatically save premium and custom fields via centralized update hook
- Sanitize both free and premium fields with centralized filter `sanitize_all_options`

🎯 **Key Features:**
- Hide prices for non-logged-in users
- Disable Add to Cart for guests
- Geolocation-based visibility (by allowed countries)
- User role-based visibility (NEW in 1.2.0)
- Custom message with `{login_url}` support
- Redirects users back to the product after login
- Integrated directly into WooCommerce settings
- Per-product custom message override (Lite)
- Test mode for admin previewing behavior
- Supports all product types (simple, variable, etc.)
- Centralized saving and sanitization (NEW in 1.2.1)
- Compatible with premium add-ons (e.g., category-based hiding)
